# 🚦 Smart City Traffic Management System

An AI-powered Smart City Traffic Management System built using **Python**, **Flask**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLOv8**. The application combines real-time vehicle detection, adaptive traffic signal simulation, congestion analytics, and an interactive dashboard into a single web application.

Designed as an educational and portfolio project, the system demonstrates how computer vision and traffic simulation can be integrated to create an intelligent traffic management solution without relying on paid APIs or cloud services.
